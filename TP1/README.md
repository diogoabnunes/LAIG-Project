## Project information

* Scale Factor available in the interface, so that it's possible to "zoom" to a section of the scene.
* Five cameras to choose in the interface (two perspective and three orthogonal), showing all scene objects implemented.
* Four lights in the scene. They all start on but can be turned off/on at any time, one by one.
  - Two on the ceiling; 
  - One simulating light from the window;
  - One in one of the walls.

* Scene: [Relative link](TP1/scenes/demo.xml)
  - The scene represents an indoor swimming pool, more specifically the FADEUP swimming pool. 
  - The pool consists of 4 walls: one with a texture applied to simulate a dull glass window and the other three with a white or gray texture, with other textures overlapped to fill the walls.
  - The pool itself has 5 starting blocks, 5 lanes separated by 4 ropes and 2 sets of flags to mark the distance of 5 meters to each lane pool wall.
